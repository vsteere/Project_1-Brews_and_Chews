## User Story

We wanted to help visitors, as well as local foodies find unique restaurants and breweries in their area.

The user will have the ability to refine their searches by location, food type, and other parameters. It will not only focus on food, but also the brewery scene, giving patrons the ability
to find and curate new experiences.

SO THAT Users can find both restaurants and breweries in the area that matches their appetite 
for good food, refreshing brews, and new experiences. With the ability to filter by location and preferences,
